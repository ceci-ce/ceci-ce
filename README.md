## Hi there 👋, I'm Cecilia

- 👩🏻‍💻 I'm currently studying Full Stack Web Development and a master's in cybersecurity.
- 👩🏻‍🎓 I've studied Digital Marketing and Ecommerce, and Fashion Design and Management.
- 🌍 I live in Madrid, Spain.
- When I'm not learning to code or exploring new technologies, I can be found lifting weights 🏋🏻‍♀️, going on a hike with my dog 🐕 and spending time with my loved ones 🤍.
